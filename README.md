# Rock Paper Scissors using python 
This is my First Github Project.
I developed this portfolio using Python IDLE framework. 
In this game, the user gets the first chance to pick the option between Rock, paper, and scissors. After the computer select from the remaining two choices(randomly), the winner is decided as per the rules.
